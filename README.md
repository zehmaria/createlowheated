Create Low-Heated modifies Create's heating system, exchanging the passive heaters for an active one. 


It changes the following:


- Adds Charcoal Burner, a block that takes charcoal and produces low heat.
- Adds new heat condition, "lowheated" can now be a Heat requirement inside recipes that use the Basin (in addition to the default "heated" and "superheated").
- When a charcoal Burner heats a steam engine step-up, it produces the amount that passive heaters would've done.
- Passive heating was disabled completely [the tagged blocks and the unfed Blaze Burner].
- If needed, the Charcoal Burner can be overly empowered by placing a max RPM'ed Encased Fan against it. When empowered, the Charcoal Burner produces heat at the same level as a Kindled Blaze Burner, but in exchange, it consumes way too much fuel [100x].


This project was designed to work in tandem with Crete Picky Wheels [plus, the intent is to pair it with capacity nerfed windmills and waterwheels].
